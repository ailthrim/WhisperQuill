## What is WhisperQuill?

WhisperQuill is a lightweight, native macOS chat client that connects to [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) — giving you access to dozens of AI models through a single, clean interface built entirely in SwiftUI.

This is a **solo hobby project** — primarily a playground for learning agentic AI-assisted coding workflows and experimenting with macOS native UI. It is not a polished commercial product, but it is a fully functional app used daily.

## Features

- **Multi-model chat** — Switch between any model available on OpenRouter mid-conversation
- **Real-time streaming** — Responses stream token-by-token with smooth animated delivery
- **Per-chat parameters** — Override temperature, top-p, max tokens, and more per conversation
- **Usage & cost tracking** — Live token counts and USD cost estimates per message and per chat
- **Auto-titling** — Chats are automatically titled by a lightweight model after the first exchange
- **JSON inspector** — Inspect the raw API response for any assistant message
- **Secure API key storage** — Your OpenRouter key lives in the macOS Keychain, never on disk
- **Native Liquid Glass UI** — macOS Sequoia system materials, SF Symbols, sidebar/detail layout

## Requirements

| Requirement | Version |
|---|---|
| macOS | 26 (Sequoia) or later |
| Xcode | 26.3 or later |
| Architecture | Apple Silicon (arm64) only |
| OpenRouter API Key | [Get one free at openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/keys) |

> **Note:** Intel Macs and iOS/iPadOS are not supported targets.

## Architecture

WhisperQuill follows a clean separation of concerns with protocol-backed layers:

```
UI Layer          NavigationSplitView → SidebarView + ConversationPane
State             ConversationStore (ObservableObject, owns all chat state)
Persistence       ChatRepositoryProtocol → SwiftDataChatRepository (SwiftData)
Engine            ChatEngineProtocol → OpenRouterChatEngine
Networking        OpenRouterService (URLSession, SSE streaming)
Design System     AppPalette color tokens · native .glassEffect() · SF Symbols
```

**Key design decisions:**
- API key lives in Keychain only (`com.josh.jchat` / `openrouter-api-key`)
- Token counts and costs are **monotonically increasing** — no refunds on delete/regenerate
- Streaming uses Server-Sent Events (SSE); authoritative cost is settled via `GET /generation` after each stream

## Roadmap

Active backlog is tracked on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/joshellis625/JChat/issues).

Current priorities:
1. Freeze prevention and transcript stability in long chats
2. UI polish toward a clean, minimal chat experience
3. OpenRouter streaming reliability and consistency
4. Feature re-expansion after stability is locked
